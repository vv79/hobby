    <h1>My Hobby is Camping</h1>

    <p>Camping is an experience best shared with friends and family, it's a great little getaway, especially during the
        summer. Enjoy some sunbathing surrounded by nature and good company. Equally, you don't have to camp exclusively
        in the summer, lots of people also enjoy camping in the rain as it brings a whole new type of ambience and
        experience to enjoy.</p>
    <p>As with most hobbies there's a bit of a buy-in. Depending on how you want to sleep, you'll either need to buy a
        small pop up tent for yourself or a decent size family tent to fit the rest of your group in. If you're pretty
        certain that you'll only ever go camping with a group of friends, you could consider splitting the cost of a
        larger tent amongst your group to save some cash, and you'll also be sorted for other group events such as music
        festivals</p>
